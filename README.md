## Prerequisites and Assumptions

- This image doesn't do much on it's own, you must use a complemenary service to pass messages or data to it via port 783.

## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/spamassassin)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofit/spamassassin:(imagetag)
```
Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-spamassassin/pkgs/container/docker-spamassassin) 
 
```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-spamassassin:(imagetag)
``` 

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory  | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/logs/`   | Spamassassin Logs                   |
| `/config/` | Configuration                       |
| `/data/`   | Volatile Data (Downloaded Patterns) |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`,`vim`.
